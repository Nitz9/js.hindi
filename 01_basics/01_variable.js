// accountId = 2  not changeable because "const"
// accountEmail = "Nitz@gmail.com"  changeable due to "let"  --- only use Let to create a variable

// accountPassword = "111111"     changeable due to "var"  (its scope is global)

// accountCity = "Mumbai"   changeable due to when a variable is declared without any prefix
